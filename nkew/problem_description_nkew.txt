Newick Format with Edge Weights

Problem

In a weighted tree, each edge is assigned a (usually positive) number, called its weight. The distance between two nodes in a weighted tree becomes the sum of the weights along the unique path connecting the nodes.

To generalize Newick format to the case of a weighted tree T, during our repeated "key step," if leaves v1,v2,…,vn are neighbors in T, and all these leaves are incident to u, then we replace u with (v1:d1,v2:d2,…,vn:dn)u, where di is now the weight on the edge {vi,u}.

Given: A collection of nn weighted trees (n≤40) in Newick format, with each tree containing at most 200 nodes; each tree Tk is followed by a pair of nodes xk and yk in Tk.

Return: A collection of nn numbers, for which the kkth number represents the distance between xk and yk in Tk.
