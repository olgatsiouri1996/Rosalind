Distances in Trees

Problem

Newick format is a way of representing trees even more concisely than using an adjacency list, especially when dealing with trees whose internal nodes have not been labeled.

Given: A collection of n trees (nâ‰¤40) in Newick format, with each tree containing at most 200 nodes; each tree Tk is followed by a pair of nodes xk and yk in Tk.

Return: A collection of nn positive integers, for which the kth integer represents the distance between xk and yk in Tk.
