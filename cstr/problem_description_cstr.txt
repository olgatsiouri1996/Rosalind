Creating a Character Table from Genetic Strings

Problem

A collection of strings is characterizable if there are at most two possible choices for the symbol at each position of the strings.

Given: A collection of at most 100 characterizable DNA strings, each of length at most 300 bp.

Return: A character table for which each nontrivial character encodes the symbol choice at a single position of the strings. (Note: the choice of assigning '1' and '0' to the two states of each SNP in the strings is arbitrary.)
